# Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i,d , and s  are already declared and initialized for you. You must:
# 
# Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
# Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your 3 variables.
# Use the + operator to perform the following operations:
# Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.
# Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
# Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.

# In[ ]:


i = 4
d = 4.0
s = 'HackerRank '
# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.
k=int(input())
l=float(input())
m=input()
# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.

# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.
sum1=i+k
print(sum1)

# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.
sum2=d+l
print(sum2)
# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
print(s+""+m)
# The 's' variable above should be printed first.
